# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Rafael!

Iâ€™m currently learning and building in the world of data engineering and analytics.  
My background so far is mostly self-taught â€“ Iâ€™ve been focusing on Python, SQL, and everything related to working with real-world data: cleaning it, exploring it, visualizing it, and making it useful.

Right now, Iâ€™m working on improving my understanding of:
- How to build and automate data pipelines
- How to work with structured and semi-structured data
- How to design small-scale data platforms using open-source tools
- How to explore and analyze data using SQL and Python

Iâ€™m aiming for an intern or junior data engineer role, and this profile is my growing portfolio where I upload what Iâ€™ve been learning and building.

## Tools & Skills Iâ€™m using

- Languages: Python, SQL  
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels  
- Tools: Airflow, Docker, PostgreSQL  
- Concepts: ETL, EDA, time series, orchestration, DWH basics  
- Currently exploring: dbt, data modeling, performance benchmarking

## Projects

### ETL Project  
[`etl_project`](https://github.com/Rafo044/DEproject/tree/main/etl_project)  
A basic but complete ETL pipeline: Python script pulls and transforms data, and Docker is used to orchestrate the setup. Learned how to use `docker-compose.yaml` to manage services and run data ingestion jobs in isolated containers.

### Airflow Project  
[`airflow_project`](https://github.com/Rafo044/DEproject/tree/main/airflow_project)  
Set up Apache Airflow in Docker to orchestrate DAGs for scheduling data tasks. This helped me understand dependencies, scheduling, and modular pipeline building.

### API Ingestion  
[`api_ingestion`](https://github.com/Rafo044/DEproject/tree/main/api_ingestion)  
Built a simple API data ingestion tool using Python. It fetches external data (with error handling), and prepares it for downstream processing.

### SQL Analytics  
[`sql_analytics`](https://github.com/Rafo044/DEproject/tree/main/sql_analytics)  
Generated synthetic data with Python and used SQL queries to perform data exploration and aggregation. Practiced basic analytics using only SQL logic.

### Parquet vs CSV Performance  
[`parquet_vs_csv`](https://github.com/Rafo044/DEproject/tree/main/parquet_vs_csv)  
Benchmarked file formats to compare read/write speeds between Parquet and CSV. This gave me hands-on understanding of how data format choices affect performance.

### Market Profit & Damage Analysis  
[Market_profit_damage_analysis](https://github.com/Rafo044/Market_profit_damage_analysis)  
Analyzed sales data to identify high-performing vs underperforming segments. Focused on calculating margin, profit, and potential financial risk.

### Daily Minimum Temperature â€“ Australia  
[daily_minimum_temperatur_Australia](https://github.com/Rafo044/daily_minimum_temperatur_Australia)  
Cleaned and visualized weather time series data to explore trends and patterns.

### Impact of Inflation on Production  
[impact_inflation_prod.ipynb](https://github.com/Rafo044/analysis_of_production_data/blob/master/impact_inflation_prod.ipynb)  
Exploratory notebook analyzing macro trends between inflation and production.

### Machine Learning Experiments  
[machine_learning](https://github.com/Rafo044/machine_learning)  
Tried out basic machine learning workflows using Scikit-learn â€” regression, classification, metrics, and more.
