# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Rafael!

Iâ€™m currently learning and building in the world of data engineering and analytics.  
My background so far is mostly self-taught â€“ Iâ€™ve been focusing on Python, SQL, and everything related to working with real-world data: cleaning it, exploring it, visualizing it, and making it useful.

Right now, Iâ€™m working on improving my understanding of:
- How to build and automate data pipelines
- How to work with structured and semi-structured data
- How to design small-scale data platforms using open-source tools
- How to explore and analyze data using SQL and Python

Iâ€™m aiming for an intern or junior data engineer role, and this profile is my growing portfolio where I upload what Iâ€™ve been learning and building.

## Tools & Skills Iâ€™m using

- Languages: Python, SQL  
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels  
- Tools: Airflow, Docker, PostgreSQL  
- Concepts: ETL, EDA, time series, orchestration, DWH basics  
- Currently exploring: dbt, data modeling, performance benchmarking

Thanks for visiting my profile. I'm still learning and experimenting step by step â€” feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to give feedback, ask questions, or share ideas.
